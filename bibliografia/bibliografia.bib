abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Purpose:Retinal image registration is a useful tool for medical professionals. However, performance evaluation of registration methods has not been consistently assessed in the literature. To address that, a dataset comprised of retinal image pairs annotated with ground truth and an evaluation protocol for registration methods is proposed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Methods: The dataset is comprised by 134 retinal fundus image pairs. These pairs are classified into three categories, according to characteristics that are relevant to indicative registration applications. Such characteristics are the degree of overlap between images and the presence/absence of anatomical differences. Ground truth in the form of corresponding image points and a protocol to evaluate registration performance are provided.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Results: The proposed protocol is shown to enable quantitative and comparative evaluation of retinal registration methods under a variety of conditions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conclusion: This work enables the fair comparison of retinal registration methods. It also helps researchers to select the registration method that is most appropriate given a specific target use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={4}, journal={Modeling and Artificial Intelligence in Ophthalmology}, author={Hernandez-Matas, Carlos and Zabulis, Xenophon and Triantafyllou, Areti and Anyfanti, Panagiota and Douma, Stella and Argyros, Antonis A},

ABSTRACT = {The world faces difficulties in terms of eye care, including treatment, quality of prevention, vision rehabilitation services, and scarcity of trained eye care experts. Early detection and diagnosis of ocular pathologies would enable forestall of visual impairment. One challenge that limits the adoption of computer-aided diagnosis tool by ophthalmologists is the number of sight-threatening rare pathologies, such as central retinal artery occlusion or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and others are usually ignored. In the past two decades, many publicly available datasets of color fundus images have been collected with a primary focus on diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and few other frequent pathologies. To enable development of methods for automatic ocular disease classification of frequent diseases along with the rare pathologies, we have created a new Retinal Fundus Multi-disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). It consists of 3200 fundus images captured using three different fundus cameras with 46 conditions annotated through adjudicated consensus of two senior retinal experts. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset, RFMiD, is the only publicly available dataset that constitutes such a wide variety of diseases that appear in routine clinical settings. This dataset will enable the development of generalizable models for retinal screening.},
