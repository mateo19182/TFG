abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Purpose:Retinal image registration is a useful tool for medical professionals. However, performance evaluation of registration methods has not been consistently assessed in the literature. To address that, a dataset comprised of retinal image pairs annotated with ground truth and an evaluation protocol for registration methods is proposed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Methods: The dataset is comprised by 134 retinal fundus image pairs. These pairs are classified into three categories, according to characteristics that are relevant to indicative registration applications. Such characteristics are the degree of overlap between images and the presence/absence of anatomical differences. Ground truth in the form of corresponding image points and a protocol to evaluate registration performance are provided.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Results: The proposed protocol is shown to enable quantitative and comparative evaluation of retinal registration methods under a variety of conditions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Conclusion: This work enables the fair comparison of retinal registration methods. It also helps researchers to select the registration method that is most appropriate given a specific target use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={4}, journal={Modeling and Artificial Intelligence in Ophthalmology}, author={Hernandez-Matas, Carlos and Zabulis, Xenophon and Triantafyllou, Areti and Anyfanti, Panagiota and Douma, Stella and Argyros, Antonis A},

ABSTRACT = {The world faces difficulties in terms of eye care, including treatment, quality of prevention, vision rehabilitation services, and scarcity of trained eye care experts. Early detection and diagnosis of ocular pathologies would enable forestall of visual impairment. One challenge that limits the adoption of computer-aided diagnosis tool by ophthalmologists is the number of sight-threatening rare pathologies, such as central retinal artery occlusion or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and others are usually ignored. In the past two decades, many publicly available datasets of color fundus images have been collected with a primary focus on diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and few other frequent pathologies. To enable development of methods for automatic ocular disease classification of frequent diseases along with the rare pathologies, we have created a new Retinal Fundus Multi-disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). It consists of 3200 fundus images captured using three different fundus cameras with 46 conditions annotated through adjudicated consensus of two senior retinal experts. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset, RFMiD, is the only publicly available dataset that constitutes such a wide variety of diseases that appear in routine clinical settings. This dataset will enable the development of generalizable models for retinal screening.},

abstract = { Image registration is one of the most challenging problems in image processing, where ill-posedness arises due to noisy data as well as nonuniqueness, and hence the choice of regularization is crucial. This paper presents hyperelasticity as a regularizer and introduces a new and stable numerical implementation. On one hand, hyperelastic registration is an appropriate model for large and highly nonlinear deformations, for which a linear elastic model needs to fail. On the other hand, the hyperelastic regularizer yields very regular and diffeomorphic transformations. While hyperelasticity might be considered as just an additional outstanding regularization option for some applications, it becomes inevitable for applications involving higher order distance measures like mass-preserving registration. The paper gives a short introduction to image registration and hyperelasticity. The hyperelastic image registration problem is phrased in a variational setting, and an existence proof is provided. The focus of the paper, however, is on a robust numerical scheme. A key challenge is an unbiased discretization of hyperelasticity, which enables the numerical monitoring of variations of length, surface, and volume of infinitesimal reference elements. We resolve this issue by using a nodal-based discretization with a special tetrahedral partitioning. The potential of the hyperelastic registration is demonstrated in a direct comparison with a linear elastic registration in an academic example. The paper also presents a real life application from three-dimensional positron emission tomography of the human heart which requires mass preservation, and thus hyperelastic registration is the only option. }
